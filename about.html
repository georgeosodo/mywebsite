<h1 class="about">Who Am I?</h1>
<p class="aboutparagraph">
	I was born and raised in Nairobi. From a young age I developed intrest in the science behind things
	and was always the best in class when it came to science. 
	This love intrest gretaly influenced my decision to take all the sciences in high school and later 
	computer science at university level.
	I decided to take computer science because I liked the dynamism of the field and I strongly believe that
	the future will be entirely built and reliant on technology.
	I also took cyber security since I also believed the security of these systems will be key.

<h1 class="about">Why MEST?</h1>
<p class="aboutparagraph">
	After completing my University education I got my first job. During my stay at the firm I realized that I wanted
	to do more with my life. I always had a feeling that programmers were born to be free to change the world with
	all kinds of ideas and not to be linited to building specific systems on a daily basis. 
	I also considered that it was best to use my prime years to build my own business rather than wok for someone so I 
	applied for MEST. When I finnaly got the chance to be part of the 2018 class I quicky dropped everything and took the chance with both hands.

<h1 class="about">Why enterpreneurship?</h1>
<p class="aboutparagraph">
	I have always admired enterpreneurs since I think they are the people with the brightest minds in society.
	Even though enterpreneurship can be challanging its rewards are usually worth it. Once the business picks up most enterpreners become financialy stable at least while some  become very wealthy.
	Another attractive aspect of enterpreneuship is the power to create jobs for society. This is very improtant
	as one enterpreneur is able able change the lives of many people by providing jobs.
